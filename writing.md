# Writing Challenge
Ada Support makes complicated machine learning tools accessible to non-technical support teams (watch our video [here)](https://adasupport.wistia.com/medias/y8vmlr5taz). Since artificial intelligence software is new to most, we see a strong opportunity to produce a digital publication that educates a general audience about artificial intelligence technology's current and future impact. In spite of a journalistic world that is increasingly filled with shallow listicles, our goal is to make this publication among the highest-quality and most thought-provoking on the internet.  

As an Ada Support Writer, and one of the first members of this team, your job will be to produce compelling content for this publication that educates, instills trust, and delights. We look forward to supporting you as you express your own research, style, and opinions. 

In consideration for this role, your challenge is to write a short piece (500 words max) that responds to the question: _"What is the future of customer support?"_. Please submit your efforts to [Nick](mailto:nick@ada.support) and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions ðŸ˜Š 

## What we're looking for 
- Educational: to what extent does your piece teach the reader something new and afford them a new perspective? Is it likely to be perceived as a "secret to be shared?"
- Trustworthy: to what extent does your piece position Ada as a trustworthy and professional organization? Is it of high-integrity and are sources cited? 
- Delighftful: to what extent does your piece provide a unique voice and / or viewpoint that leaves the reader wanting to read more?
