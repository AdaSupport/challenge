## Marketing Designer

As a Marketing Designer, your job is to visually articulate all information about Ada and its customers through a variety of different mediums. The types of content you will produce will vary and require consistent quality, tone, and care.

One of the most important tools in the B2B marketing toolset is the official company website. We drive all of our marketing traffic to the website, which serves as a brochure speaking directly to our target market about our product and company. Success for our website is an increased number of qualified leads (prospects that are a good fit for our product).

Your job will include ensuring that the website is effectively communicating through it's visual and structural design who we are and how our product helps our customers.

### Challenge:

Slack has learned that their homepage has a high bounce rate (visitors leaving quickly without clicking through anywhere on the page). The marketing team at Slack has learned that there are **two** distinct groups of visitors: 

1) The first group is looking to sign up for the service quickly and they don't need to engage with any Slack content.

2) The second group is visiting the homepage looking for more information to understand _who_ is using Slack and _why_ they should use it.

Your challenge is to review the [Slack homepage](https://slack.com/) and provide **3** changes you would make to reduce the bounce rate on the **second group of visitors**.

When you are finished, please send me the piece in for feedback.
