## Marketing Designer

As a Marketing Designer, your job is to visually articulate all information about Ada and its customers through a variety of different mediums. The types of content you will produce will vary and require consistent quality, tone, and care.

At Ada, the marketing and sales teams work very closely together. Beyond the many marketing projects you'll be working on, an important activity will be supporting the sales team in revising their materials. These will include sales decks, proposals, case studies and white-papers. 

Your challenge is to revise an existing Ada overview that will be sent to prospective clients in advance of a phone call or meeting. The purpose of this overview is to clearly articulate what Ada Support does and why the client should be using us.

Please use the style and branding guidelines linked below when revising the overview.  As an additional challenge please incorporate the value props noted below as their own section.

When you are finished, please send me the piece in for feedback.
Have fun, and please be sure to ask me questions during the process. Email Nick ðŸ˜Š
