## Marketing Designer

As a Marketing Designer, your job is to visually articulate information about Ada and its clients through a variety of media. 

The types of content you will produce will vary, requiring consistent quality, tone and care.

One of the most important tools in the B2B marketing toolset is the official company website. We drive all of our marketing traffic to ada.support, which serves as a brochure for our target market about our product and company. Success for our website means an increased number of qualified leads (prospects that are a good fit for our product).

Your job will include ensuring that the website effectively communicates, through its visual and structural design, who we are and how our product helps our clients.

## Challenge:

- Pick three websites that reflect design you think would serve well as inspiration for Adaâ€™s own website.
- Put together a short presentation on why you chose each site and what you think those sites do well in the context of selling a new SaaS product.
- Include visuals from the website (screenshots are fine) and be explicit about the parts of the pages you think are great.
- Submit this in Google Docs or Google Slides.
- Have fun, and please be sure to ask me questions during the process. Email Nick ðŸ˜Š

Note:
Please keep the submission to 1 page or less of written ideas with no limit on visuals. If itâ€™s a Google Slides presentation, keep it to no more than 5 slides.
