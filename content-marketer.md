# Blog Post Challenge

As a Content Marketer & Communications Specialist, your job is to clearly articulate all information about Ada and its customers. The types of content you will produce will vary and require consistent quality, tone, and care.

An important activity you will be performing at Ada is writing blog posts for both customers and prospects. It will include product announcements, educational blog posts, social media engagement and investigative articles.

Your challenge is to write a short blog post that announces a new feature (this is a fictional feature) to both customers and prospects. You will also need to submit a brief (bullet points please) plan on how you'd creatively distribute the post to get the most reach with our target market (VPs and Heads of Customer Support).

Don't feel pressured to copy the existing announcements on the company blog. Make it your own and consider what you think is the best way to communicate it. See below for the details of this fake feature.

When you are finished, please send me the piece in a google doc for feedback.

Have fun, and please be sure to ask me questions during the process. Email [Nick](mailto:nick@ada.support) ðŸ˜Š 

 
## Feature To Announce

The feature is a way for new Ada customers to quickly get their bot up and running by uploading their entire FAQ from [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) (a support platform). After uploading their information, Ada processes the FAQ using machine learning to convert the content into Ada friendly answers. To help you wrap your head around Adaâ€™s dashboard, check out the quick video overview in the resources section.

For context, right now you cannot do this and if you want to add new answers you need to manually input them inside the Ada editor.
