# Blog Post Challenge

As a Content Marketer & Communications Specialist, your job is to clearly articulate all and any information about Ada and its customers. The types of content you will produce will vary and require consistent quality, tone, and care in ensuring the ease of understanding for readers.
 
An important activity you will be performing at Ada is writing blog posts for both customers and prospects. It will range from product announcements to education on how AI works for customer support.
 
Your challenge is to write a short blog post that announces a new feature (this is a fictional feature) for both customers and prospects to consume. You will also need to submit a very brief (bullet points please) plan on how you'd creatively distribute the post to get the most reach with our target market, which are VPs and Heads of Customer Support. 

Don't feel pressured to copy the existing announcements on the company blog. Make it your own and consider what _you_ think is the best way to communicate it. See below for the details of this fake feature.

When you are finished, please send me the piece in a google doc for feedback. 
 
Have fun, and if you have questions, please feel free to contact [Nick](mailto:nick@ada.support) ðŸ˜Š 
 
## Feature To Announce

The feature is a way for customers of Ada (those who create and manage bots) to upload their entire FAQ database from a knowledge base software into Ada. After uploading, the information is processed using machine learning made by Ada and then converted into "chat friendly", also known as very concise, answers.

For context, right now you cannot do this and if you want to add new answers you need to manually input them inside the Ada editor.
 
## Challenge Requirements
