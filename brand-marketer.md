# Brand Marketer Challenge

As a Brand Marketer, your job is raise awareness and generate buzz about the company, product, and its customers. There are many different ways to build awareness about Ada and create brand recognition, but it will be your responsibility to identify the best intitiatives and to articulate a strategy to accomplish goals you set out with the Head of Growth Marketing.

Your challenge is to create a 30/60/90 day plan that includes your ideas on how you will create a strong brand in the minds of our target audience (Directors of Support at enterprise B2C companies).

When you are finished, please send me the piece in a google doc for feedback.

Feel free to ask me questions during the process. Email [Nick](mailto:nick@ada.support) ðŸ˜Š
