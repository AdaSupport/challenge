# Outreach Challenge

As a Business Development Representative and an early member of Ada Supportâ€™s sales team, youâ€™ll be responsible for generating new qualified business opportunities.

An important activity you will be performing at Ada is creating cold email campaigns to send to prospects. The goal of these campaigns is to generate enough interest in Ada leading to prospects booking an introductory phone call. 

Your challenge is to write an email campaign that is targeting new prospects from the perspective of a live chat provider (not Ada). Please submit the initial email you would send in the campaign, 3 companies you would approach with which employees you would outreach to (just their roles is fine), as well as a brief 3-4 bullet point strategy for the follow-up emails in the campaign.

When you are finished, please send everything over in a google doc for feedback. 

Have fun, and please be sure to ask me questions during the process. Email [Dan](dan@ada.support) ðŸ™‚

## Email Campaign to Send

The live chat provider you will be creating the email campaign for is [Happy Fox](https://www.happyfox.com/).

## Challenge Requirements
- Initial outreach email
- List of 3 companies with key contacts
- Plan for follow-up emails
