# Challenge
Hi there :wave: This is our challenge for potential new team members. It's a simple TODO app that uses WebSockets. The challenge here is to fix some bugs, make some improvements and ship your code.

## Checklist
Here's the list of things we'd like you to do:

- [ ] Fix all the bugs
- [ ] Add a feature that allows users to complete tasks
- [ ] Add a feature that allows the closing of all tasks
- [ ] Make it look good on mobile devices (iOS 10 Safari is good enough)
- [ ] Make a design change to improve the user experience
- [ ] Open a PR

## Set Up
Please work in new branchThis is a Node app so you'll need Node and NPM to get it up on its feet.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Test
You should write tests as you work through the checklist. Run your tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Publish
When you're all finished, open a PR with your branch and we'll review it.
