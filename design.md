# Ada Design Challenge

![](http://i.imgur.com/uGUHkZq.jpg)

A part of the app that our customers have complained about is adding, removing and editing "Quick Reply" buttons presented to the chat user at the end of their Answers. Quick Reply buttons allow a conversation to prompt the user with common subsequent questions to an Answer. _For example,_ if someone needs help with their phone and your bot needs to know what kind of phone they have, our customer would add a Quick Reply button that will take the user to an "iPhone" answer so the user doesn't have to type out "iPhone". Quick Reply buttons also allow a customer to guarantee some content will only be shown if a button is pressed.

The task is to improve the component of our app thatâ€™s responsible for creating and editing Quick Reply buttons that should be returned at the end of an Answer based on specific feedback from customers:


> "Iâ€™ve seen buttons on the default answers that came with my bot, but I donâ€™t know how to add buttons to my own answers"


> "Iâ€™ve added a button, but I donâ€™t understand how to make the label of the button my own custom text"


> "How do I reorder my Answerâ€™s buttons?"


> "How do I see when an Answer is referenced by another Answers button? (linking)"


> "How do I remove a button when itâ€™s been added to my Answer?"


By now you should have received an invitation to your own bot which you can use to play around and test with. Feel free to make/edit anything in this bot as you learn about how things work. [Watch this video to see how the component currently works](

## Process
You're free to follow any design process you want. If you wanted to ask questions to the users who submitted the above feedback, you should email the questions to [this address](mailto:david@ada.support?subject=Challenge). We promise they'll be answered quickly ðŸ™Œ.

## Submission
The point of this challenge is to help us see what your best effort is across a wide array of product design skills, but at a small scale. Your submission shouldn't take longer than a day, but it should be at least a lo-fi mock-up that a development team could implement.

**Succesful submissions usually consistent of one or more of these:**
- Some static `.sketch` Artboards
- An interactive prototype (Sketch, Invision, Framer etc...)
- Slides
- Sketches
- Documentation
- Anything else that shows off your skills! âœ¨

## After Submission
- We (at least [David](https://twitter.com/davehariri)) will review your design.
- If your submission is accepted, you'll get to come in and meet our team, present your design to our product team and engage in a fun in-person design review. The review will explore your process and solution in a friendly critique. Lunch and travel expenses will be covered.
- If your submission isn't accepted, we'll give you very rich feedback on why and what we think you can improve.

We canâ€™t wait to see what you come up with! Good luck! and [email us](mailto:david@ada.support) when youâ€™re finished!
