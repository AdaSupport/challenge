# Ada Design Challenge
A part of the app that our customers have consistently complained about is adding/removing/editing buttons to their Answers. The task here is to re-design the component of our app thatâ€™s responsible for choosing buttons that should be returned after the messages of an Answer. The specific feedback from customers has been:


> Iâ€™ve seen buttons on the default answers that came with my bot, but I donâ€™t know how to add buttons to my own answers


> Iâ€™ve added a button, but I donâ€™t understand how to make the label of the button my own custom text


> How do I reorder my Answerâ€™s buttons?


> How do I see when an Answer is referenced by another Answers button? (linking)


> How do I remove a button when itâ€™s been added to my Answer?


By now you should have received an invitation to your own bot which you can use to play around and test with. Feel free to make/edit anything in this bot as you learn about how things work. The component [currently works like this](

## Deliverables

The point of this challenge is to help us see what your best effort is, but at a small scale. Your submission should be as complete of a design as you would make for a product development team to run with. This could be some sketch files, an Invision mock up, a framer prototype or anything else you want us to see that shows off your skills and talent!

We canâ€™t wait to see what you come up with! [Email David](mailto:david@ada.support) when youâ€™re finished and good luck! ðŸš€
