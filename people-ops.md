# People Ops Challenge

Your responsibilities as Ada's first People Ops team member include leading recruitment, office management, and employee onboarding. This challenge focuses on your third key responsibility.

## Problem
Ada is comprised of 6 teams that work closely together to solve problems and push the company forward. But as our team is growing quickly, new team members are not getting the same attention as early members were.

As new employees join, it's critical that we give them a strong understanding of the different teams and their cross-functional relationships. On top of this, new employees need to understand how the product works, who it works for, and why decisions were made that led its development to its current state. As of today, there is no process in place for facilitating this. Employee-onboarding has happened on an ad-hoc basis thus far. 

From understanding team collaboration including their specific role within the company, to knowing the product inside and out,  new employees should be introduced to the company with an appreciation for why our culture and their role is important to our collective success. Our culture is inclusive of 6 values and general office/team etiquette.

## Solution 
Design a measurable employee on-boarding strategy that addresses the problems above. Propose how you will know whether it's successful. Try to limit your strategy to a single page.

Please ask questions along the way, and submit your challenge to [Mike](mailto:mike@ada.support) ðŸ˜Š
