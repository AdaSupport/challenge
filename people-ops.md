# People Ops Challenge

Your responsibilities as Ada's first People Ops team member include recruitment, office management, and employee onboarding. This challenge focuses on your third key responsibility.

## Problem
Ada's team is growing quickly and new team members are not getting the same attention as early members were. As a result, it's taking too long for new members to learn about Ada's culture, meet all team members, and ultimately be a productive and happy member of the team.

## Solution 
Design a measurable employee on-boarding strategy that addresses the problems above. Propose how you will know whether it's successful. Try to limit your strategy to a single page.

Please ask questions along the way, and submit your challenge to [Mike](mailto:mike@ada.support) ðŸ˜Š
